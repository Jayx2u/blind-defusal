# Blind Defusal - The Game
A two-player, cooperative "bomb defusal" game heavily inspired by "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"! One player is the `Operator` who has the physical device, and the other is the `Expert` who has the instruction manual but cannot see the device. Their goal is to disarm all the modules on the device before the timer runs out.


## How to Play
1. A person picks `Operator` and the other person picks the `Expert.` The `Operator` gets the bomb whilst the `Expert` gets the [manual](https://blind-defusal.jayx2u.fyi/). **Players are not allowed to look at each other's materials.**
2. The `Game Master` will set up the "Wire Pulling" module according to the instructions on the display located on the bomb when it is turned on. During this time the `Expert` is allowed to look over the manual but shall not communicate yet.
3. The `Game Master` will then start the game resulting in a five-minute timer starting. During this time, the players are allowed to communicate to each other only through verbal instructions and questions.

You either win by disarming the bomb by completing all the modules or losing by getting three strikes or making a fatal mistake - instantly detonating the bomb.
